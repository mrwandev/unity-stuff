This project(two dots) needs :

	+ Folders in "0_twoDots" folder

	+ And "IngameDebugConsole" plugin in "Plugins" folder (not really necessary, but u should disable "IngameDebugConsole" prefab in twoDots' scene or delete it to ignore the plugin)

	+ Sprites and TextMesh Pro Folders

	+ And finally "twoDotsClass.cs" script in scripts folder
